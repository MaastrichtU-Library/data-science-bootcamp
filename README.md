*The following examples and implementations are not general Data Science rather financial use cases.*

---
### Bootcamp Goals
* Introduce the basics of the python programming environment such as functions, reading and manipulating CSV files, and the NumPy library.  
* Introduce data manipulation techniques using pandas data science library.  
* Introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data
structures for data analysis.  
* Develop a general understanding of data formats and representations.  
* Get an overview of some python visualization packages.  
* Learn how to perform a data science pipeline and their best use cases.

### Python for Data Science
* Python is an open-source high-level, interpreted, programming language.  
* A data science/text analytics project may include everything from scraping data from
the web, analyzing a mixture of text and numerical data, computing features, training
a model, creating high-quality graphs, and then hosting a web app with results.  
* 70,000 libraries in the Python Package Index  
* It has a massive user community, who contribute to a large number of high-quality,
well maintained open-source tools.  
* Widely used in industry and academia.
